When campus placements are conducted, information of candidates is provided to the companies
visiting the campus. As a lot of information has to be provided like personal details of candidates,
CGPA, technical skills, skill sets etc., this could be quite hectic. At times, the candidates find it
difficult to know that which companies they are eligible for.
Placement management for candidates and companies is a system that provides secure and up to
date information of all the candidates to the companies and administration. It is versatile and very
easy to use.
