Developed in PHP , a basic Website that handles and stores student as well as company data for which the students can apply as well as the the list of eligible candidates.

Well structured backend but will work on the front-end soon.
Find the code in the PHP-code branch

When campus placements are conducted, information of candidates is provided to the companies
visiting the campus. As a lot of information has to be provided like personal details of candidates,
CGPA, technical skills, skill sets etc., this could be quite hectic. At times, the candidates find it
difficult to know that which companies they are eligible for.
Placement management for candidates and companies is a system that provides secure and up to
date information of all the candidates to the companies and administration. It is versatile and very
easy to use.
