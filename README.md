# Placement-Website
Developed in PHP , a basic Website that handles and stores student as well as company data for which the students can apply as well as the the list of eligible candidates.
This runs on a local server preferred XAMPP.
It uses Mysql as a database.
Well structured backend but will work on the front-end soon.
